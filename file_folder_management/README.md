# File and Folder Management with Python

This section includes basic automation scripts using Python to manage files and folders.

## Scripts

### 1. `create_rename_delete.py`
- Creates a folder.
- Renames it.
- Deletes it.

### 2. `move_copy_files.py`
- Copies a file from one folder to another.
- Moves files using `shutil`.

### 3. `auto_file_cleanup.py`
- Deletes `.log` files older than 7 days from a specified folder.

## Requirements
No external libraries are needed. These scripts use Pythonâ€™s built-in `os`, `shutil`, and `time` modules.

## How to Run
```bash
python script_name.py
